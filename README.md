# MyTown
<b>Timeline:</b> Mar 2020 - June 2020<br>

## About the project
<div align="justify">The purpose of the project My Town is to improve the environment and raise awareness of the individualâ€™s responsibility in keeping their city cleaner and healthier. With the mobile application My Town, users will be able to identify and solve certain environmental challenges or inform other users and relevant institutions about the current environmental problem in the city that needs to be resolved. In addition to reporting or solving a challenge, users will be able to post a publication that will represent the positive side of ecology (for example, a nicely arranged park). Since the application will be available in multiple cities, the vision expands to reducing environmental pollution at the national level. The main goal of the application is to be simple to use and understandable, so that it can be used by all generations and people who have minimal technical knowledge. In addition to the mobile application, there will also be a web application that can be accessed by institutions and system administrators. The main role of the institutions is to solve the challenges that the users have reported and thus motivate other users to take action. The administrator will have access to special web pages where he can approve an account for an institution, review statistics, add a new administrator and manage users and their posts.</div>
